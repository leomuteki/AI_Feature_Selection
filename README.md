# AI_Feature_Selection
A feature selection algorithm given data that is organized in rows of instances and columns of features. The first column must be the instance ID. The number of unique instance IDs can be set at the top of the source code as the global constant "INSTANCES". The three heuristics are forward selection, backward elimination and a furthest center of mass heuristic.
